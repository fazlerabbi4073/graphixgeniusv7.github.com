    .....image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, to remove the
    background of an image. It involves creating a path around the subject using
    the pen tool, and then using that path as a mask to hide the background and
    create a transparent or solid color background. The resulting image can then
    be placed on top of another background or integrated into a design. <br>
    
     Clipping
    path is often used for product photography and e-commerce images, where the
    product needs to stand out and be presented on a clean, white background. It
    can also be used for other types of images where the subject needs to be
    separated from the background, such as portraits or architectural
    photography.
     <br> Multi-path, on the other hand, is a more advanced technique
    that involves creating multiple paths for different parts of an image. This
    is often used for complex images with multiple subjects or objects, where a
    single clipping path may not be sufficient to achieve the desired result.
    <br>
    For example, multi-path may be used to separate different colors or
    components of a product image. In this case, the image would be separated
    into multiple layers, with each layer containing a different color or
    component. Each layer would then have its own clipping path, allowing for
    precise control over each element of the image. <br> Multi-path can also be used
    to isolate specific elements of a photo for individual editing. For example,
    if a photo contains multiple people, each person could be placed on a
    separate layer with their own clipping path, allowing for independent
    editing of each person's appearance. <br> Overall, both clipping path and
    multi-path are important techniques in graphic design and photo editing, and
    are commonly used by professionals in the field to achieve high-quality
    results.
