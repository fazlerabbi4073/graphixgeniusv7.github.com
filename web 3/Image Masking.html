    ..................  to
    selectively hide or reveal parts of an image based on their transparency
    values. This can be done using a layer mask in raster-based image editing
    software, such as Adobe Photoshop, or a vector mask in vector-based image
    editing software, such as Adobe Illustrator. <br>
     Let's take an example of
    product photography. Suppose you have an image of a product that you want to
    use for your e-commerce website. However, the product is on a cluttered
    background and you want to remove the background and replace it with a
    clean, white background. <br> 
    Using image masking, you can achieve this by
    creating a layer mask around the product and hiding the background. Here's
    how you would do it in Adobe Photoshop: <br>
     1.Open the image in Photoshop and
    create a duplicate layer of the image. <br>
    2. Select the Pen Tool from the toolbar
    and carefully trace around the product, creating a path that separates it
    from the background. <br>
    3. Once the path is complete, right-click on it and select
    "Make Selection" from the dropdown menu. <br> 
    4. In the Layers panel, click on the
    Add Layer Mask button to create a layer mask. <br>
    5. You can now hide the
    background by painting on the layer mask with black or reveal it by painting
    with white. <br>
     With the background removed, you can now place the product on a
    clean, white background and use it for your e-commerce website. <br>
     Another
    example of image masking is creating custom shapes or patterns for design
    elements, such as logos or icons. In Adobe Illustrator, you can create a
    vector mask around a shape or pattern and use it to hide or reveal parts of
    the image. <br> 
    For example, suppose you have an image of a tree and you want to
    use it as part of a logo. However, you want to use only the silhouette of
    the tree and remove the details of the leaves and branches. <br>
     Using image
    masking, you can achieve this by creating a vector mask around the
    silhouette of the tree and hiding the details. Here's how you would do it in
    Adobe Illustrator:
    <br>
    1. Open the image in Illustrator and create a new layer. <br>
    2. Use
    the Pen Tool to carefully trace around the silhouette of the tree, creating
    a vector path. <br>
    3. With the path selected, click on the Make Mask button in the
    Transparency panel. <br>
    4. You can now hide the details of the tree by painting on
    the mask with black or reveal it by painting with white. <br>
     With the details
    hidden, you can now use the silhouette of the tree as part of your logo. <br>
    Overall, image masking is a powerful technique in graphic design and photo
    editing that allows designers and editors to achieve precise, high-quality
    results.
