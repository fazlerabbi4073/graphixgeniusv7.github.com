    .......... different wavelengths of light that
    are reflected or emitted by objects, which produce different sensations of
    hue, saturation, and brightness in the human eye. Color can be described by
    its hue (the specific color, such as red or blue), saturation (the intensity
    or purity of the color), and brightness (the amount of lightness or darkness
    of the color). Color is an important aspect of visual communication and can
    be used to convey meaning, emotions, and aesthetic qualities in various
    forms of art and design.
    
    
    Color Correction: <br><br> 
    Color correction is the process
    of adjusting the colors in an image to achieve a more balanced and natural
    look. The goal of color correction is to remove color casts, improve
    contrast, and make the colors look more accurate and consistent across
    different devices.<br>
     There are several ways to correct colors in an image,
    including using adjustment layers in Photoshop. Some of the most commonly
    used adjustment layers for color correction include Levels, Curves,
    Hue/Saturation, and Color Balance.<br> 
    To use the Levels adjustment layer, for
    example, you can adjust the black and white points in the image to adjust
    the brightness and contrast. This can help bring out details in the shadows
    and highlights of the image.<br>
     Using the Curves adjustment layer, you can
    adjust the tone of the image and correct for any color casts. By creating a
    curve, you can adjust the brightness, contrast, and tonal range of the
    image. <br>
    Hue/Saturation and Color Balance adjustment layers can be used to
    adjust the color balance of the image. By selectively adjusting the hue,
    saturation, and luminosity of specific colors, you can balance out the
    overall color balance of the image.<br>
     Recoloring:<br><br>
      Recoloring is the process of
    changing the colors of an image or an object within an image. This can be
    done for many reasons, such as to create a new color scheme, to change the
    mood of the image, or to correct color imbalances in an image.<br>
     In Photoshop,
    you can use several tools to recolor an image, such as the Color Replacement
    Tool, Selective Color adjustment layer, Gradient Map adjustment layer, and
    more.<br>
     The Color Replacement Tool can be used to replace a specific color in
    an image with a different color. You can use this tool to recolor objects
    within an image or to change the background color of the image.<br>
     The
    Selective Color adjustment layer can be used to adjust the colors of
    specific color ranges in an image. By adjusting the color sliders, you can
    change the color of specific elements in the image, such as making a blue
    sky appear more green.<br>
     The Gradient Map adjustment layer can be used to
    apply a gradient of colors to an image. By selecting a gradient and
    adjusting the color stops, you can create a new color scheme for the image.<br>
    Overall, color correction and recoloring are important skills for a graphics
    designer to master. By using the right tools and techniques, you can make
    your images look more polished and professional.
