    or hollow man, is a photography technique used to showcase clothing in a way
    that makes it appear as if it is being worn by an invisible model. The
    technique involves photographing a garment on a mannequin and then removing
    the mannequin in post-processing using image editing software. The result is
    a 3D-like effect that makes the clothing appear as if it is being worn by an
    invisible model, with the inside of the garment visible. This technique is
    commonly used in e-commerce, fashion, and clothing photography to showcase
    products in a more visually appealing way and give customers a better idea
    of how the clothing will look and fit when worn.

    The process of creating ghost mannequin photography involves several steps.
    First, a photographer will take photos of a garment on a mannequin from
    different angles. To make the editing process easier, the photographer will
    often use a mannequin that is a similar size and shape to the intended
    wearer of the garment. The photos should be taken in a well-lit environment
    to ensure that the colors and details of the garment are accurately
    captured. <br />
    Next, the photos are edited using image editing software such as Adobe
    Photoshop. The photographer will remove the mannequin from the photos using
    techniques such as masking, layering, and cloning. They will then combine
    the different angles of the garment to create a 3D-like effect, with the
    inside of the garment <br />
    When done correctly, ghost mannequin photography can create a more dynamic
    and engaging image of a garment than a traditional flat-lay or hanging
    photograph. It can also be more cost-effective than hiring a model for every
    garment, and it allows the customer to focus solely on the garment without
    any distractions. <br />
    However, ghost mannequin photography does require a certain level of skill
    and expertise in both photography and image editing. It's important to
    ensure that the lighting is consistent across all photos and that the
    editing is seamless to create a convincing final result. <br />
    Overall, ghost mannequin photography is a popular technique used in the
    fashion and e-commerce industries to showcase clothing in a visually
    appealing way and give customers a better understanding of how the garment
    will fit and look when worn.
